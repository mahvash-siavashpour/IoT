# WIFI
The NodeMCU board used in this project has a wifi chip that can be in two modes: Station and Access Point.
In station mode it is able to connect to other devices and networks and in access point it can create a local network of its own. In these projects we aimed to utilize the wifi ability of this board in different real-word problems.

## Station_Mode
In this simple implementation of the station mode the module is able to scan all the wifi networks nearby and show them on a serial monitor. It can also connect to each of them if the password is provided. 
## Access_Point_Mode
In this project the NodeMCU module works as a network provider and created a local wifi network with a static IP address.
